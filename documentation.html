            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p> As you can see after you finish the third level, the game is still work in progress; more levels will be available in the future with new topics from the HTTP
            theory.</p>
            <p> We hope that the game, in the way it was conceived, represents a solid foundation for learning and developing the notions around the HTTP protocol area.</p>
